# Challenge_03_Random_Password_Generator

## Description
This project requires retracting the code on the Javascript files to
generate a random password where the user is prompted to chose password criteria. 

The main focus of the retracting of the javascript file are as follows:
* Creating code that will allow the user to select criteria for a random generated password
* User will be introduced to a series of promts for password criteria
* User will have to decide the length of the password which needs to be between 8 to 128 characters long 
* User will decide to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters in their password
* At lesat on character type should be selected

## Tools used during this project
* The use of a while loop to have certain parameters met. In this example the input length of the password must be between 8 and 128 characters
* The use of an 'if' statemetn with the 'confirm' function along with a string and boolean to prompt the user
* Using the 'concat' method to add user's input for the generated password based on the confirm function
* Created a 'for-loop' to push the user's input from the confirm function to generate a password
* Finally the event listener to have a 'click' to write the password
